# Implementation proposal: PAC-13

Linear issue: https://linear.app/paceday/issue/PAC-13/add-contract-for-each-feature
Title: Add contract for each feature
Contract revision: 1
Contract hash: f80b2d1d43e289711b3ec046b16bc93764a883c743e8c63e5a1d9eedc1c1b84a
Target repository: smart-calendar-flow

## Issue context

Each feature should have an associated contract; contract should be on the codebase, and they should be used to generate the documentation. 
Also, add an API swagger

## Proposed bounded changes

- Inspect the existing smart-calendar-flow structure and identify the smallest files required by the approved contract.
- Implement only the approved database/API/frontend boundaries; do not invent endpoints or fields.
- Add provider, consumer, and acceptance tests for the contract scenarios.
- Run the local test commands and attach their output before requesting implementation approval.
